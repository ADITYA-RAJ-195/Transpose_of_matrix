Project: Dijkstra-C by Maximetinu
URL-https://github.com/Maximetinu/Dijkstra-C
üìÅ Project Overview
This project provides an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using an adjacency graph. It supports both directed and bidirectional graphs and offers various input/output options, including terminal and CSV file support. Additionally, it can visualize computed shortest paths using Graphviz.

üîç Code Structure Analysis
The project is organized into multiple header files, each serving a specific purpose:

dijkstra.h:

Contains the core algorithm for calculating the shortest path.
GitHub

IO_dijkstra.h:

Handles input and output operations, including reading graph data and displaying results.
GitHub

graph_drawer.h:

Manages the visualization of the graph using Graphviz.

üß© Function Documentation
dijkstra.h:

dijkstra():

Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

IO_dijkstra.h:

read_graph_from_csv():

Reads graph data from a CSV file and constructs the adjacency graph.
GitHub

print_shortest_path():

Displays the shortest path from the source node to a target node.

graph_drawer.h:

generate_graph_image():

Generates a visual representation of the graph using Graphviz.
